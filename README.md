### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Mathematician and Economist** turned **Technologist**. My background isn't just code—it's founded in the rigorous analysis of complex systems, honed at UChicago and refined through years of financial consulting for top-tier banks and insurance providers.

Currently, I operate as a **Fractional CTO** and **Solo Entrepreneur**, architecting high-stakes systems for startups. As the CTO of **ProNexus**, I led technical strategy, hiring, and the development of enterprise-grade security standards aligned with ISO 27001. I have single-handedly shipped MVPs for numerous early-stage ventures, ranging from AI-driven beauty tech to marketplace platforms.

My work often bridges the gap between theoretical models and production software—I've drafted game theory whitepapers on cybersecurity risk and now build the systems that prevent it. When I'm not shipping code, I'm an unapologetic Linux tinkerer (Arch + Hyprland) and robotics enthusiast.

### 🔌 The Garage (Non-Coding)

I don't just write software; I build things in the physical and digital worlds.

* **Game Design:** I've designed multi-year D&D campaigns with custom cartography and lore.
* **Current Build:** I am hacking a vintage **Billy Bass singing fish** to act as a physical interface for a home-assistant Siri clone.
* **Hobbies:** Robotics, Electronic Engineering, and configuring my [Omarchy](https://github.com/rpupo21) Hyprland setup.
