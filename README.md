### 📖 My Story

I don't come from a traditional tech background. I studied math in undergrad and went straight into consulting. I left that world about 2 years into it with the intention of making a startup, but without a product idea, a team, and or even the knowledge of how to build or sell. In the spirit of failing fast and learning fast, my best plan was to match with someone off YCombinator's startup matching platform, immediately say yes to their idea, build their MVP, see if the product was something people wanted and my cofounder someone who could sell it, and repeat.

After about half a year of cofounder and idea searching, I landed on my first full-time CTO role at ProNexus, where I solo-developed an AI-powered, email-reading and expert finding tool for consultants. I'm hoping to build my first unicorn by 2030 and happy to talk with anyone interested in this journey.

### 💭 My Personal Philosophy

I take my work seriously, but I don't take myself seriously. The corporate world made me realize too much of a care for self-image and presentation got in the way of good ideas, communication, and work. I strive to make work fun by putting my focus on the mission and the product over myself.

At the same time, I believe in bringing back the wonder we had for tech in the early 2000's. Right now, social media and profit incentive have made every innovation a grift and every metric a target. My goal is to show my peers that anyone can be Iron Man or make Flubber and that there is much more than just profit in doing so.
